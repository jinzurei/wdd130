                    <p>Our purpose is to create unforgettable river adventures that bring people closer to the wild
                        beauty of the canyonlands,
                        journeys filled with excitement, connection, and discovery. Every trip is guided by our
                        commitment to safety, our
                        responsibility of stewardship for the river and its environment, and the pure stoke that comes
                        from paddling together
                        through the rapids, sharing laughter, and building memories that last a lifetime.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <div class="history__grid">
                <p>Founded by local guides born and raised for the Green River rapids, we grew from one raft to a
                    community-driven
                    outfitter. What started as weekend runs for friends and neighbors turned into a small garage
                    operation, then a full
                    fleet as word spread that our trips felt like rafting with family. We learned every bend and eddy
                    the hard wayâ€”early
                    mornings, late take-outs, and a commitment to safety that's now baked into how we train every guide.
                    As Moab blossomed,
                    we stayed rooted: partnering with local schools and businesses, volunteering for river clean-ups,
                    and mentoring new
                    boaters each spring. Today our boats carry first-timers, multi-day adventurers, and returning guests
                    who bring their
                    kids back to meet the same guides they trusted years ago. Through high water and low, our mission
                    hasn't changed: run
                    fun, responsible trips, take care of our rivers, and treat every guest like a longtime friend.</p>

                <p>Our team is passionate about sharing the thrill of whitewater with new friends and old, always
                    putting safety and fun
                    first. Every trip is an opportunity to spark laughter, build memories, and inspire a deeper respect
                    for the river. From
                    teaching first-timers how to paddle through their first rapid to guiding seasoned adventurers down
                    challenging
                    stretches, we bring the same energy and care to every ride. Our guides are not only trained
                    professionals, but also
                    storytellers and stewards of the canyon, pointing out hidden petroglyphs, wildlife along the banks,
                    and the unique
                    geology that makes Moab so unforgettable. Above all, we believe that adventure and safety go hand in
                    hand, and that the
                    best days on the water are the ones where everyone leaves with soaked clothes, tired arms, and a
                    huge smile.</p>
